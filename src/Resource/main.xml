    <!-- Service definition -->

    <!-- The set of model definitions provided here are restricted to shipping
        requests only. The original idea was to model it in a way that any other
        service could also be purchased but abstracting out a coordinator definition
        was difficult due to absence of defined use-cases. Hence, we expect to evolve
        the purchase structure but will ensure backward compatibality -->

    <documentation target="PSRService">

        for purchasing services provided by Amazon Logistics. It supports
